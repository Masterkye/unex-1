Add CSS to your resume.

The CSS should be in a separate file from the .html file, and look good :-).
Among other things, it should use color for emphasis, bearing in mind
the principles of Contrast and Consistency we discussed in Session 1.

The document should use the "Ek Mukta" font throughout, installed
dynamically from fonts.google.com. Font sizes should scale to be
readable on the device you're using

The resume should have a picture in it if it doesn't already.

The picture should be in the upper right corner of the general-information
paragraph of your resume when at full screen resolution or when printing.
You may make no assumptions about screen resolution or page width width
when you do the positioning.

When viewed at cell-phone width, the picture should
be centered and above the text

Somewhere in your document, I want a "bulleted list" implemented without
using <ul>, <ol>, or <li> elements. The "bullet" should be any arbitrary image.

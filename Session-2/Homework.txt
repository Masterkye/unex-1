Homework:

1.	Create a wireframe for a web site that advertises your own services as a
	web-site-creation company.

2.  On your local web site, create an index.html page that holds your resume.
	It must contain a picture of yourself, your contact info (which can be
	fictional if you like), and your work and education history.
	It should look as good as it can, given what we know, using both HTML
	layout and semantic elements appropriately.

3.  Check your work into your GitHub repository and send me (via a Slack
	direct message) the Github URL for that repository.

I need access to your github repo before next Wednesday at the absolute
latest. Send me the URL of your repository. Also, sign up for Slack.

Put off until next week:

	There should be a contact-me form at the bottom of the page, where
	a potential client can send you their name and contact information.
	The form should submit to http://holub.com/echo.php (so you can see
	what information is received by the server).
